A highly motivated and driven student at the University of Sheffield interested in circular manufacturing and sustainability, particularly in the technical textiles industry. As a part of her final year research project, Freya is creating a life cycle analysis of a monomaterial waterproof jacket for a premium British Outdoor Brand and conducting a meta analysis of waterproof membranes available on the market.

Freya hopes to work on sustainability and performance in the textiles industry for outdoor goods, as she has a great love for adventures and the outdoors, which she loves to explore through trail running and road cycling. Alongside her studies at University she completed her first 70.3 Ironman and is currently training for her first ultramarathon raising money for Mind - a youth mental health organisation.
