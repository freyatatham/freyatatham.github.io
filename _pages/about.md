Freya Tatham is a creative-thinking london based materials enthusiast with a passion for exploring innovative and sustainable solutions. Her work is driven by a commitment to creating designs that are not only functional but also environmentally responsible. Freya believes that great design should have a positive impact, and she brings this philosophy into every project by embracing circular practices and exploring eco-friendly materials.

Inspired by the outdoors, Freya finds endless creativity in nature’s textures, colors, and forms. When she’s not working in the studio, she’s often outside, hiking or exploring landscapes that fuel her imagination and remind her of the beauty worth preserving through thoughtful design.

Freya’s approach is grounded in curiosity and a love for learning, making her an adaptable designer always eager to challenge conventions and create something meaningful.
