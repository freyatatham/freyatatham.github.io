Introduction to my channel crossing microplastic investigation.

Setting sail for science: a micro mission!

Channelling my inner scientist as I cross the English Channel
======

This summer, I’m not just chasing the tide — I’m tracking the tiny. From the shores of Jersey to the far side of the English Channel, I’m sailing straight into the swirling story of microplastics. Armed with a net, some labware, and a possibly overconfident sense of direction, I’m diving into a plastic problem that's as invisible as it is impactful.

When I said I wanted a summer project, I didn’t mean just sunbathing. Instead, I’ll be setting sail from Jersey to explore the not-so-visible invaders in our seas: microplastics. Armed with curiosity and a sieve, I’m turning my boat into a floating lab.
